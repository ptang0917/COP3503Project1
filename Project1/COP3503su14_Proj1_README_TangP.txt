Known Bugs
COP3503su14_Proj1_TangP would "close" if the following input is not an integers
If the users resets the current set with option 6, load f1 to the current set with option 1, and union the current set with another file with option 2, then when printing the current set, the output would be different from union the current set without resetting the current set with option 6.
